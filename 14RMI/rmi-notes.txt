Rmi  System allows an object running in one JVM to invoke methods on an object in another JVM. RMI can communicate only between programs written in Java.

Architecture of RMI :
--------------------------
ClassObject ---> Server --->skeleton class--->stub--->  Client


Procedure for developing RMI Application :
---------------------------------------------------
ServerSide :
------------

1)Create a Remote interface which contains collection of member functions (remote methods) declaration those will be defined in Remote Class.

2) Create a Remote class and inherit Remote interface & define all remote interface methods (javac remoteservlerclass.java)

3) Create Stub & Skeleton classes for created Remote Class (Using rmic.exe syntax : rmic RemoteServerClassName)
4) Start Remote Server (start rmiregistry.exe)
5) Register the Remote class object into server (java remoteserverclass)


Client Side :
-------------
6) Copy both Remote Interface and Stub class into client Machine from the server.
7) Create Client Application & use remote server class object in  any client connected in a Remote Server.


Stubs

	->	It connects to the remote JVM
	->	It serializes any arguments to a remote methods
	->	it reads the values returned by a remote method
	->	it return the value to the client

Skeleton

	->	it reads the parameters for the remote object
	->	it locates the object to be called
	->	it invokes the desired method on remote object
	->	it transmits the result to the stub.


The RMI Packages

 	- java.rmi
	- java.rmi.server
	- java.rmi.registry


==> java.rmi Package

	- The Remote Interface
	- The remoteException class

	- The Naming class

 The Naming class

This class provides method for storing and acquiring References of remote objects in the remote object registry.

Methods - bind(), lookup(), rebind(), unbind(), list().


Steps

	1. Type the interface program
	2. Type the implementation program
	3. Server program
	4. Client Program

	5. Compile all the programs (javac program.java)
	6. Create Stub and Skeleton (rmic implementationprogramname)
		dir -> List the programs
	7. Cmd 1 -> Start rmiregistry
	8. cmd 2	-> Run Serverprogram
	9. cmd 1 ->Run Client Progr -> You got result at client screen
